# 🚀 SmartLife AI – Personalized Insurance Recommendation Platform

SmartLife AI is an advanced insurance personalization platform, crafted for the SBI Life Hackathon 2025. Powered by the **MERN Stack** and **AI-driven insights**, it delivers hyper-personalized insurance recommendations tailored to each user's unique profile and behavior.

---

## 🏆 Why SmartLife AI?

> **Current Challenge at SBI Life:**  
> SBI Life relies on a persona-based segmentation (1000+ segments), which lacks the granularity to truly understand individual user needs. This results in generic recommendations and lower conversion rates.

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

- **🔬 Unlock Deep Personalization:**  
    Harness AI to analyze customer preferences, behaviors, and needs at an individual level.

- **📈 Drive Smarter Upselling:**  
    Suggest optimal policy terms, pricing, and durations for each user.

- **🤝 Boost Customer Loyalty:**  
    Enhance policy adoption and long-term satisfaction through tailored experiences.

---

## 🤖 AI at the Core

We’ve integrated the **LLaMA model (Hugging Face)** to power a smart AI chatbot that:

- Understands user profiles and queries in real time
- Recommends insurance policies that fit each user’s needs
- Acts as a 24/7 virtual assistant

> ✅ **AI Chatbot is live and fully functional in the User Panel!**
